## Key Features

1. **Diverse Classification Projects**:
   - Binary and multi-class classification problems.
   - Supervised and Unsupervised model
   - Real-world datasets with varied complexity.

2. **Algorithms Used**:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - K-Means
   - Agglonerative Clustering
   - DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering Application with Noise)
   - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - ROC-AUC Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Silhouette Score

4. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical features (e.g., one-hot, label encoding).
   - Scaling and normalization of numerical features.
   - Feature selection and importance analysis.
   - Hnadling Imbalanced Data
