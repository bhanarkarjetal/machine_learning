# Data Modeling Projects

Welcome to my repository of data modeling projects! This repository contains various data science and machine learning projects where I apply different models to solve real-world problems. Projects in this repository demonstrate my understanding and implementation of different algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, model evaluation methods, and data visualizations.

## Projects

Here are some of the data modeling projects available in this repository:

### 1. **Linear Regression Model for Mobile Phone Price Prediction**
   - Predicts the price of mobile phones based on various features such as battery, RAM, internal memory, and CPU specifications.
   - Data preprocessing techniques such as log transformation, square root transformation, Box-Cox transformation, and polynomial features were applied.
   - Performance evaluation was done using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2).

### 2. **Stock Price Prediction Model**
This model predicts a stock's closing price based on various features such as opening price, low, high, adjusted closing price, and trading volume.
- Data preprocessing techniques were applied, including data transformation, scaling, polynomial feature transformation (degree 2), and regularization methods (Lasso and Ridge).
- The model performance was evaluated using R-squared (RÂ²) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess the accuracy and generalization of the predictions.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are commonly used across my projects:
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: Numerical computing
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: Data visualization
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms and tools
- `statsmodels`: Statistical modeling
- `scipy`: Scientific computing
